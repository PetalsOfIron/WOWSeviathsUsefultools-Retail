-- Seviath's Codex — Farming: the best places to make gold
-- Summarised in our own words from community gold guides (Midnight, 2026):
-- wow-professions.com (herbalism/mining routes), wowvendor.com (Aug 2026,
-- skinning / cloth / BoE spots), playnews.gg and nexttier.pro (old content).
-- No reliable gold-per-hour numbers exist — prices differ per realm — so
-- each spot shows LIVE auction prices when Auctionator is installed.

Wild nodes summon mobs when gathered (herbs and ore) — kill them for extra materials, or pull them away from the node so nobody steals it.\n\nNeeds decent gear.

  body = [[
A raid is a big instance for many players, made of several bosses (often grouped in wings). You go through it boss by boss.

]]..C.."What to expect on a first raid night"..R..[[
• A raid night usually lasts two to four hours. Raid Finder runs are shorter.
• Raid leaders explain each boss before the first pull. Listen; the plan matters more than your damage.
• ]]..C.."Wipes are normal."..R..[[ A new boss can take many tries. Each try teaches the group something.
• Bosses have phases: the fight changes at set health or after set times. The leader names them ("phase two", "intermission").
• Waiting is part of it: a pause to explain, drink, repair and re-pull.
• You do not need to be perfect, but you need to follow the plan and stay alive.

]]..C.."Difficulties"..R..[[
• Raid Finder (LFR) — queue alone, easiest, many players, no group plan needed. A good first look.
• Normal and Heroic — you join a guild or a Premade group. Sizes are flexible (about 10 to 30 players).
• Mythic — a fixed number of players (20) and the hardest mechanics. Usually for organised groups.

Each boss gives loot once a week per difficulty (the lockout). The weekly reset is Wednesday in Europe, Tuesday in the Americas.

• ]]..C.."Raiding is as old as the game."..R..[[ The first raids, Molten Core and Onyxia's Lair, came with the 2004 launch; Molten Core was for up to 40 players.
• ]]..C.."Raid Finder"..R..[[ arrived in the Dragon Soul patch of Cataclysm so that players without a guild could see the bosses.
• ]]..C.."Flexible raid sizes"..R..[[ (a group of any size within a range) arrived at the end of Mists of Pandaria.
• ]]..C.."Mythic raids"..R..[[ with a fixed 20 players arrived in Warlords of Draenor and replaced the old 10 and 25 player split.
• ]]..C.."A raid has several bosses"..R..[[ in a set order or in wings that open one after another. The first boss is the easiest, the last the hardest.
• ]]..C.."One kill per boss per difficulty per week."..R..[[ That is the lockout. A new week resets it.
• ]]..C.."Tier sets"..R..[[ are sets of armor pieces that drop as tokens in the raid. Wearing two and four pieces gives set bonuses.

Five minutes of reading saves many wipes.

1. ]]..C.."Open the Adventure Guide (Shift+J)"..R..[[ and read the boss in the Journal. Abilities carry role icons: tank, healer, damage.
2. ]]..C.."Find this boss in the Codex"..R..[[ (Bosses). It shows the abilities and the way in.
3. ]]..C.."Read a written guide for your role"..R..[[ (Wowhead, Icy Veins, Method). It lists the plan and the mistakes.
4. ]]..C.."Watch one short video"..R..[[ if you learn better that way. A good video shows positions and timing.
5. ]]..C.."Ask your leader"..R..[[ what the group will do differently from the guide (some groups change the strategy).

What to know about each boss:
• ]]..C.."Phases"..R..[[ — when the fight changes and what you do in each.
• ]]..C.."Deadly abilities"..R..[[ — the ones that kill if you stand wrong or miss a soak.
• ]]..C.."Your job"..R..[[ — tanks decide positions and swaps; healers plan cooldowns; damage dealers kill the right target and interrupt.
• ]]..C.."The enrage"..R..[[ — a timer after which the boss becomes too strong. It sets how fast you must kill.

  body = [[
A good order for a new raider:

1. ]]..C.."Raid Finder"..R..[[ — queue alone, learn the bosses and their looks, and collect gear. You do not need a plan.
2. ]]..C.."Normal"..R..[[ — join a group that explains each boss. Gear from Raid Finder helps.
3. ]]..C.."Heroic"..R..[[ — harder mechanics and better gear. Groups often have a plan and expect you to know it.
4. ]]..C.."Mythic"..R..[[ — 20 players, tight mechanics and no room for mistakes; usually a guild with a schedule.

Tips:
• Do not skip Raid Finder; it is a free tour of the bosses.
• Say you are new when you join a group; most will help.
• Item level is a guide, not a rule. Skill matters more.
• Raid in a group you enjoy. A friendly guild is worth more than a fast one.
• Check the Group Finder listing for what a group expects (item level, experience, a voice chat).

]]..C.."Damage dealers"..R..[[ — kill the right target: the boss, a marked add, or a group of adds, as the plan says. Use interrupts and stops on dangerous casts. Move out of bad effects and keep dealing damage while you move. Save big cooldowns for the right phase or for bloodlust.

• Stand where the plan says (melee behind the boss, ranged spread, healers within range).
• Follow call-outs: stack, spread, soak, move.

Words you will hear in raid chat and voice:

• ]]..C.."Stack"..R..[[ — stand close together to share damage or healing.

• ]]..C.."Soak"..R..[[ — stand in a circle or marker so its damage is shared instead of killing one player.
• ]]..C.."Swap"..R..[[ — the second tank takes over the boss.
• ]]..C.."Tank buster"..R..[[ — a big hit on the tank; the tank uses a defensive.
• ]]..C.."Cleave / cone"..R..[[ — an attack in front of the boss; do not stand there.
• ]]..C.."Adds"..R..[[ — extra enemies. "Kill adds" means target them first.
• ]]..C.."Kite"..R..[[ — keep moving so a slow enemy never reaches you.
• ]]..C.."Bait"..R..[[ — stand somewhere on purpose so a later effect lands where it can do no harm.
• ]]..C.."Dispel / cleanse"..R..[[ — remove a harmful effect from a player.
• ]]..C.."Interrupt / stop"..R..[[ — end a cast with a kick or a stun.
• ]]..C.."Phase / intermission"..R..[[ — a part of the fight and a short pause between parts.
• ]]..C.."Enrage"..R..[[ — the point after which the boss kills everyone.
• ]]..C.."Burst"..R..[[ — a window to use your strongest abilities.
• ]]..C.."CD"..R..[[ — cooldown. "Use your CD" means use a defensive or raid cooldown.

• ]]..C.."Pre-potion"..R..[[ — a combat potion used just before the pull starts its boost for the first burst. A second potion can be used later when the cooldown is back.
• ]]..C.."Personal burst"..R..[[ — use it every time it comes back unless the next phase starts soon.
• ]]..C.."Raid cooldowns"..R..[[ — healers and some classes have a group-wide defensive. A plan assigns each one to a dangerous moment so they do not overlap.

• ]]..C.."After a wipe"..R..[[ — click Release Spirit and run back, or accept a resurrection from a player who survived. In many raids you can use the spirit healer or a graveyard near the entrance.

• ]]..C.."Pace"..R..[[ — a key is fast. Most groups pull big and keep moving. A run takes about half an hour or more, depending on the dungeon and the level.
• ]]..C.."Pulls"..R..[[ — several groups at once. The tank decides. Follow the tank.
• ]]..C.."Silence is normal"..R..[[ — many groups do not talk. Short messages in chat are welcome, such as "kick Boss", "defensive used" or "need a drink".
• ]]..C.."Deaths"..R..[[ — each death costs time. One or two do not ruin a run; many do.
• ]]..C.."Interrupts"..R..[[ — in higher keys a missed interrupt can wipe the group. Kick on time.

A checklist for the first key:

1. ]]..C.."Gear"..R..[[ — your item level should match the dungeon's suggested level or a little above for the key level.
2. ]]..C.."Know the dungeon"..R..[[ — read a route guide (Wowhead, Icy Veins, Method) and watch a run. The Codex shows the bosses.
3. ]]..C.."Know the affixes"..R..[[ — read this week's affixes in the Mythic+ window.
4. ]]..C.."Know your kicks"..R..[[ — the list of casts you must interrupt or stop.
5. ]]..C.."Know the bosses"..R..[[ — what each does and what kills the group.
6. ]]..C.."Pick the right group"..R..[[ — join "learning" or low keys first.
7. ]]..C.."Say it"..R..[[ — "first time in this dungeon" is welcome and saves wipes.

]]..C.."Affixes"..R..[[ are extra rules added to a key. They change from week to week and from season to season.

• Read them at the keystone or in the Mythic+ window before you start.
• ]]..C.."Fortified"..R..[[ and ]]..C.."Tyrannical"..R..[[ alternate: one makes ordinary enemies stronger, the other makes bosses and their helpers stronger. Plan big pulls or boss time accordingly.
• Higher keys add more affixes. Your defensives and interrupts matter more.
• Each season adds its own affixes and rules. A guide for the season explains them.
• Use affix guides (Icy Veins, Wowhead, Method) for the current rotation.

]]..C.."Everyone"..R..[[
• Stand out of bad effects.
• Use bloodlust on a boss or a very big pull.

In keys, kicks decide runs.

• ]]..C.."Share the work"..R..[[ — say who kicks which enemy ("I kick the left one"). Without a plan, kicks overlap.
• ]]..C.."Use stops"..R..[[ — stuns, knockbacks and silences also end a cast. Use them when the kick is on cooldown.

  tags = "help search waypoint",
  body = [[
Type anything in the search box at the top — a boss, a dungeon, an item, a mount, a pet, an achievement, a title — and the Codex searches every section at once. Click a section on the left to browse it by expansion or type.

]]..C.."Buttons on a page"..R..[[

• Show on map — puts an arrow on your map and minimap (uses TomTom if you have it).
• Adventure Guide / Collections — opens the matching Blizzard window.
• Wowhead link — a link you can copy (Ctrl+C) for full comments and guides.

]]..C.."Where the data comes from"..R..[[

Dungeons, raids, bosses, abilities, loot, entrances, mounts, pets, achievements, transmog sets and quests are read straight from your game client, so they are always correct for the current patch. The first time you log in it takes a minute or two to read most of it in the background.

Quests are the big one: the Codex asks the server about every quest once (about 30–60 minutes of background reading the first time, it pauses in combat and continues next login). After that they load instantly. Each quest page shows only what to do — the objectives — not the story text. The bar at the bottom shows progress.

Slash commands: /codex, /codex <search>, /codex minimap, /codex reindex]] },

1. Finish your starting area and the introduction quests — they teach movement, combat and your class.
2. Pick a ]]..C.."specialization"..R..[[ (Talents window, N) — it decides your role: tank, healer or damage.
3. Level by questing, running dungeons (the Group Finder queues you automatically) or both.
4. Talk to ]]..C.."Chromie"..R..[[ in Stormwind or Orgrimmar to choose which older expansion you level in (Chromie Time). Pick the one whose story or look you like most — they all level you equally.
5. The level cap in Midnight is 90. At max level the current expansion opens up: world quests, delves, dungeons, raids, professions and renown.

Tip: set your Hearthstone at an inn in a city you visit often. It's your free teleport home.]] },

Every class has 2–4 specializations. Each spec has one role:

]]..C.."Tank"..R..[[ — holds the enemies' attention and takes the hits. Leads the pace in dungeons.
]]..C.."Healer"..R..[[ — keeps the group alive.
]]..C.."Damage (DPS)"..R..[[ — kills things, avoids standing in bad stuff.

You can change spec any time out of combat for free. Talents are saved per spec as loadouts, and you can import builds people share as text strings (Talents window » Import).

Where gear comes from, from easiest to hardest: world quests and leveling » normal/heroic dungeons and delves » Mythic+ and raids.

Most current-season gear can be ]]..C.."upgraded"..R..[[ at an upgrade vendor in the expansion hub using the season's upgrade currencies. The tooltip shows the upgrade track (for example 2/6).

Stats: your main stat (Strength, Agility or Intellect) matters most; secondary stats (Crit, Haste, Mastery, Versatility) depend on your spec — check a class guide for priorities.]] },

Useful habits:
• Right-click a quest giver's quest in the tracker to see it on the map; Shift+click a quest in the log to track it.
• Click the small bag-sort button at the top of your bags to tidy them, and use "Sell all junk" at any vendor (the coin button that appears there).

  body = [[
When a dungeon or raid drops an item, everyone who can use it gets a roll window:

]]..C.."Need"..R..[[ — only if the item is an upgrade for the spec you are playing (or you will use it as a main item).
]]..C.."Greed"..R..[[ — you would sell or disenchant it, or use it as a spare.
]]..C.."Transmog"..R..[[ — you only want the look (shown when you do not have the appearance yet).
]]..C.."Pass"..R..[[ — you do not want it.

Manners that keep groups friendly:
• Do not Need on gear for another spec or for selling, unless the group agreed.
• Say "hi" and "ready" in chat; tell the group if you are new — they will explain the bosses.
• Do not leave right after a wipe; one more try is often enough.
• Tanks lead the pace: in a dungeon follow the tank unless told otherwise.

Loot you won can be traded to a group member within 2 hours if it is not an upgrade for you.]] },

• ]]..C.."Defensive abilities"..R..[[: every class has a few. Use one when your health is dropping, not at one percent.
• ]]..C.."Health potions and food"..R..[[: eat or drink out of combat to heal; potions work in combat.

If you die:
• Click ]]..C.."Release Spirit"..R..[[ and run back to your body as a ghost; when you stand on your corpse press Resurrect. Or accept a resurrect from a healer.
• The ]]..C.."Spirit Healer"..R..[[ revives you right away at a small durability cost if the run back is too far.

Your quest log (L) holds a limited number of quests; abandon old ones you don't need. Use the map (M) — objective areas are highlighted and the tracker on the right shows progress.

]]..C.."Fishing"..R..[[ — equip a fishing pole and cast near water or at a fishing pool (patches of bubbling or rippling water). Lures raise your skill for a short time. You catch fish for Cooking, gold and sometimes pets and mounts.

]]..C.."Archaeology"..R..[[ — open the Archaeology window, pick a dig site on the map and use the survey tool to find fragments. When you have enough, solve the artifact for transmog, toys, pets and rare mounts. It is slow and relaxing.

• ]]..C.."Patch"..R..[[ — an update. The numbers tell you the size: 12.0 is the expansion, 12.1 and 12.2 are big content patches (new zones, raids, features), and the third digit (12.0.5) is a smaller update.
• ]]..C.."Raid opening"..R..[[ — raids do not all open on day one; they open in steps after launch, and higher difficulties come a little later.
• ]]..C.."Season"..R..[[ — a period of several months inside an expansion. A new season resets the Mythic+ rating, changes the Mythic+ dungeon list and gear item levels, and brings new upgrade currencies and rewards.

A piece has a rank in its track (for example 2/6); upgrade vendors raise the rank with ]]..C.."crests"..R..[[ and gold.

In general, harder content gives a higher track:
• ]]..C.."World"..R..[[ — world quests, rares and Prey hunts give the lower tracks; harder Prey difficulties give higher ones.
• ]]..C.."Dungeons"..R..[[ — Heroic gives lower tracks; Mythic gives higher ones.
• ]]..C.."Delves"..R..[[ — higher tiers and bountiful delves with a coffer key give better gear.
• ]]..C.."Mythic+"..R..[[ — higher keys give higher tracks, and the Great Vault slot for a high key is the best one.
• ]]..C.."Raids"..R..[[ — each difficulty gives a higher track than the one below it. Each boss gives loot once a week.
• ]]..C.."Crafted gear"..R..[[ — quality and upgrades come from the profession (crests and special materials).
• ]]..C.."Great Vault"..R..[[ — one pick each week, usually better than what you could find in the same week.

How to climb: get mid-track gear from Mythic dungeons and delves, then higher tracks from keys and Heroic raid bosses. Upgrade the pieces you will keep. Do not spend crests on gear you will replace next week.

Good places: ]]..C.."Wowhead"..R..[[ (database and guides), ]]..C.."Icy Veins"..R..[[ and ]]..C.."Method"..R..[[ (class and content guides), ]]..C.."Warcraft Wiki"..R..[[ (reference), and Blizzard's own news and forums for patch notes. Your guild and the Codex in this addon are good too.

How to tell a guide is old:
• It mentions currencies, mounts or systems from earlier expansions only as if they are the current ones.
• The patch or season in the title is not the current one.
• Item level numbers are far from what you see in the game.
• The page is a "boost" or "account" sale page in disguise. Many search results for game guides are shops. A shop page can contain correct information, but it exists to sell you something.

Rules of thumb:
• Check the date and the patch number first.
• Compare two sources. If they disagree, ask in game or check the in-game text.
• Class tips and numbers change more than basics like "stay out of the red".
• In the game, the tooltip is the final word.]] },

The honest answer: ]]..C.."the best class is the one you want to keep playing."..R..[[ The strongest class on paper is a bad choice if it bores you. Every class can level, do delves, run dungeons and raid. The differences between them are small next to the difference between a player who enjoys the game and one who does not.

Choose in this order:

1. ]]..C.."How do you want to fight?"..R..[[ Close up or from a distance? With a pet or without? Quick and busy, or slow and simple?
2. ]]..C.."What role do you want?"..R..[[ Tank, healer or damage. Tanks and healers are asked for more often, so groups form faster for them.
3. ]]..C.."What do you want to do most?"..R..[[ Play alone, run dungeons with friends, raid, PvP, collect things. See "Choosing by what you want to do".
4. ]]..C.."What do you like to look at?"..R..[[ You will look at your character for hundreds of hours. Armor type, weapons and effects matter.
5. ]]..C.."Then check the lists."..R..[[ Tier lists are the last step, not the first (see the tier list pages).

Try before you commit: leveling to 10 on a few classes takes an hour each. You can change spec for free out of combat, so a class gives you 2 to 4 ways to play. Your Warband shares mounts, pets, toys and appearances, so a second character never starts from zero.

• ]]..C.."Your role"..R..[[ — a tank or a healer is wanted first.
• ]]..C.."Your item level"..R..[[ and, for Mythic+, your ]]..C.."rating"..R..[[.
• ]]..C.."Utility"..R..[[ — a group often wants a bloodlust (shaman, mage, evoker or a hunter pet) and a battle resurrection (for example druid, death knight, paladin or warlock). Having one is nice; groups rarely refuse a good player over it.
• ]]..C.."Your attitude"..R..[[ — the note you write. "Learning, will listen" helps more than you think.

What groups usually do not need:
• A "top" spec. In keys below the highest levels, play what you enjoy. If a leader refuses a spec only because of the tier list, find another group.
• A perfect build. A reasonable build and clean play beats a copied one played badly.

If a group says "no X spec", do not argue. The Group Finder always has another group.]] },

You can have ]]..C.."two primary professions"..R..[[ and the secondary ones (Cooking, Fishing, Archaeology). Ask yourself:

1. ]]..C.."What do I want from it?"..R..[[
   • Gold — see "How to know which profession pays".
   • Gear and consumables for myself — a crafting profession (blacksmithing, leatherworking and tailoring make gear; alchemy, cooking and inscription make potions, flasks and food).
   • Fun and collecting — some professions give toys, pets, housing decor and cosmetic rewards; archaeology and fishing are calm.
2. ]]..C.."Do I like to run around or sit and craft?"..R..[[ Gatherers spend their time in the world. Crafters spend it in cities and at the Auction House.
3. ]]..C.."Can I afford the start?"..R..[[ Gathering costs nothing but time. Crafting needs materials, which you buy or gather.
4. ]]..C.."Can my other characters help?"..R..[[ Your alts can take the professions your main did not. With your Warband, you can supply each other.

Rules of thumb:
• A good start for a first character is one gathering and one crafting profession that go together (see the next page).
• Change your mind early. Before you drop a profession, read the warning in the profession window to see what you lose.
• Do not pick by a list alone. The best profession is the one you will actually use each week.]] },

]]..C.."Crafting professions"..R..[[ turn materials into goods:
• Alchemy — potions, flasks, cauldrons (herbs).
• Blacksmithing — plate and mail armor, weapons (ore).
• Engineering — gadgets, tools, some gear (ore, other parts).
• Enchanting — improves gear; disenchants gear into materials.
• Inscription — glyphs, tomes, some gear items (herbs).
• Jewelcrafting — rings, necklaces and gems (ore, gems).
• Leatherworking — leather and mail armor (leather).
• Tailoring — cloth armor, bags and some utility (cloth from monsters).

]]..C.."Pairs that save work"..R..[[
• Mining + Blacksmithing, Jewelcrafting or Engineering.
• Herbalism + Alchemy or Inscription.
• Skinning + Leatherworking.
• Tailoring needs cloth, which drops from enemies; it pairs with any gathering.
• Enchanting pairs with any crafting profession that makes gear, since you can disenchant it.
• Two gathering professions (for example Herbalism + Mining) are a simple way to make gold without ever crafting.

Cooking and Fishing go well with any pair. You can level them alongside.

Questions that decide it:
• ]]..C.."How early are we in the expansion?"..R..[[ Early on, gatherers do well: everyone needs materials and few are in stock. Later, as materials pile up, crafters of gear and consumables often earn more.
• ]]..C.."Are products quality-based?"..R..[[ If a product has quality tiers, a good crafter can sell a better version for more. If there are no tiers, many sellers compete and margins stay thin.
• ]]..C.."How many are selling it?"..R..[[ Many cheap listings mean competition.
• ]]..C.."What do raiders and key runners need this week?"..R..[[ Flasks, potions and food sell best before raid nights.
• ]]..C.."Can you make it at a profit?"..R..[[ Price of the item minus the price of materials, minus the 5% Auction House cut.

Tools that help:

• ]]..C.."Crafting orders"..R..[[ — a customer posts the item they want. You craft it and earn the commission. You can answer public orders, or orders sent to you personally or to your guild. Order profit depends on your realm, how many customers there are and how much they pay.
• ]]..C.."Concentration"..R..[[ — a resource that refills slowly with time. Spending it improves the quality of a craft. If you save it, you can use it at the busiest time.
• ]]..C.."Timing"..R..[[ — orders tend to be best before raid nights and Mythic+ runs. Saving Concentration for these busy periods can give you better margins.

How to get the numbers:
1. ]]..C.."Time it."..R..[[ Farm for 15 minutes and count what you looted. Multiply by four. The Farm Session window in this addon does this and shows the gold gained.
2. ]]..C.."Look up the price"..R..[[ of each item on the Auction House (scan with this addon) and use the price you can really sell at, not the highest listing.

4. ]]..C.."Compare"..R..[[ with the "Worth grinding" verdict, the "What To Farm Next" list and the Best Grinding Spots in this addon, and with a different activity such as a bountiful delve or world quests.

Things that change the result:

• ]]..C.."Selling too much"..R..[[ — if you put 200 of one item on the market, you lower its price. Sell some now and keep some for later.
• ]]..C.."Price swings"..R..[[ — prices change with patches, raid days and new seasons.
• ]]..C.."Drop rate"..R..[[ — a rare drop can pay well but make a bad hour.
• ]]..C.."Bag space"..R..[[ — a spot that fills your bags fast costs you a trip to sell.
• ]]..C.."Your own gear"..R..[[ — if you kill slowly, a spot with strong monsters is worse for you than for someone else.

]]..C.."Then, by what you do"..R..[[
• Mythic+ player: Angry Keystones (timers) and a nameplate addon such as Plater.
• Collector or explorer: HandyNotes, RareScanner, AllTheThings.
• Crafter or gold maker: CraftSim and Auctionator.
• Comfort: Leatrix Plus (auto-repair, auto-sell junk, tidy minimap).
• Farming, rares, decor, delves and auction tools: Seviath's Useful Tools.

]]..C.."How to install and keep them safe"..R..[[
1. Use the CurseForge or Wago app, or download from CurseForge, Wago or WoWInterface. Do not take addons from links in chat or from video descriptions you do not trust.
2. The addon goes into the folder Interface\AddOns inside the game's retail folder (the apps do this for you).
3. Start the game. At the character screen click AddOns to see them and switch them on or off.
4. If an addon causes errors or lag, switch it off and test again. Disable them one at a time.
5. After each game patch, update the addons. If one says it is out of date, check its page for a new version before you force it on.
